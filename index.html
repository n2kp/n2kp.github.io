            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Full Stack Developer | Stargazer | Photographer | Traveller</p>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always been fascinated with technology, but in particular, computers and the world wide web. </p>
          </div>
          <p>For years I have been involved with technology in one form or another. My engineering degree taught the fundamentals of the physical world and gave me an insight into the most cutting edge technology used to help humanity move forward. Then in my professional career, I experienced a more detailed view of the computing side of technology, where I was involved in recruiting and managing teams of developers, technical support staff and electrical systems engineers. But as much I enjoyed my job, I never felt fulfilled. I saw my teams work on exciting and contemporary projects, all the time wishing I had the skills to sit alongside them and create products which made a difference. The urge finally overcame me and I decided to take the plunge and begin a new career.</p>

      <h2>WHY CODING AND THE FUTURE</h2>
      <p>Having always had a keen interest in how things work, I decided to do an engineering degree at university. I learnt many topics such including computational fluid dynamics, material science and electrical systems engineering. However, it was during the course that I had my first experience with coding, using a machine language called Fortran to program computer numerically controlled robot arms. After graduating, I then spent many years recruited and managing teams of developers. I yearned for a career that allowed me to be creative and solve problems. Coding was the answer.</p>
      <p>Going forward, I am looking to develop and hone the skills that I have learnt so far, so I can adapt them to take on new and exciting challenges. I strive to learn new languages and frameworks, which will give me the ability to pursue different avenues in developing ideas and producing bodies of work that are not only functional but helpful and essential.</p>
