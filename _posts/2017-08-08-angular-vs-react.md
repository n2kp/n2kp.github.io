The reason I wrote this article is because none of the articles published already — although they contain great insights — go in-depth enough for a practical front-end developer to decide which one may suit their needs.

In this article, you will learn how Angular and React both aim to solve similar front-end problems though with very different philosophies, and whether choosing one or the other is merely a matter of personal preference. To compare them, we will build the same application twice, once with Angular and then again with React.
